## Election-Audit Summary

This report provided some good election information. It gives
us information about votes cast. We can also see that Denver
county had cast over four-fifths of the votes. It clearly
shows the Diana DeGette is the winner of the election.

I believe even more value informatation could be captured in
this report. The spreadsheet created below shows all items that
could possibly be.

By adding these elements we can easily see:

- Doane has a consistant vote percentage of around 3%.
- The largest popularity vote difference was in Denver county.
- DeGette and Stockham are the top runners.
- In Jefferson county, Stockham did win, but not by much.

We not only have the grand totals for each candiate but we have
the break down of votes and percentages by county. This may prove
to be more valuable than the grand totals.
