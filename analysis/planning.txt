#       1. open the .csv file
#       2. count all the records using a for loop (or accumulate total_votes_cast while you are looping through to get the total number of votes for each canditate)
#       3. list all the candidates recieving votes (ever record has a candidate...so, we don't have to check if the candidate received a vote)
#           define LIST candidate_votes we need to have candidate_name and vote_tally.
#           read record
#           does the canditate exist
#           if they do exist, read next record
#           if they don't exist, write them to a LIST 
#
#       4. as we are looping through the records, for each candidate +1 to their vote_tally
#       NOTE: we are at the end of this for-loop
#       5.
#       define another LIST having the candidate_name and their vote_percentage
#       so now, we take the results we have placed in our candidate_votes LIST and we take the candidates votes, 
#       divide them by total number of votes and multiply them by 100
#       
#       6. an if statement asking if the previous canditate's vote_tally is higher then the lasts within a for-loop
