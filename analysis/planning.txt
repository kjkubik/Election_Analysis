#       1. open the .csv file
#       2. count all the records using a for loop (or accumulate total_votes_cast while you are looping through to get the total number of votes for each canditate)
#       3. list all the candidates recieving votes (ever record has a candidate...so, we don't have to check if the candidate received a vote)
#           define LIST candidate_votes we need to have candidate_name and vote_tally.
#           read record
#           does the canditate exist
#           if they do exist, read next record
#           if they don't exist, write them to a LIST 
#
#       4. as we are looping through the records, for each candidate +1 to their vote_tally
#       NOTE: we are at the end of this for-loop
#       5.
#       define another LIST having the candidate_name and their vote_percentage
#       so now, we take the results we have placed in our candidate_votes LIST and we take the candidates votes, 
#       divide them by total number of votes and multiply them by 100
#       
#       6. an if statement asking if the previous canditate's vote_tally is higher then the lasts within a for-loop

# Challenge Requirements: 
•	The voter turnout for each county
•	The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
•	The county with the highest turnout

#7. To get the turnout for each country we need to accumulate the totals for each county. We are already accumulating total votes. 
#   So, right around where we are tallying grand total of votes, we could ask "hey what county is this vote in?" Whatever the answer is tally to that county.
#8. After we have all the the votes by county and the grand total of votes, we calculate each counties % while looping though the county votes LIST/Dictionary
#9. While we are getting the percentages, we also ask "is this the highest turn out?" (that is, initialize highest-turnout to 0, and write an if statement 
asking if the county's turn out is larger than highest turnout. If it is, we move that turnout into highest turnout.
